<h1><u>Technology Opportunities</h1></u>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the opportunities presented by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>
<p>There are many opportunities for this as government surveillance can protect people from sort of attack, enhancing security and safeguard the well-being of individuals. Extending this discussion, I am going to discuss the benefits of governmental surveillance, from mitigation of public health risks or outbreaks, prevention of crime and terrorist attacks. Along with that, surveillance can enhance workplace productivity, and reducing crime rates. </p>
<p>The most important aspect is how government surveillance has the potential to protect people from forms of attacks, especially terrorism. Authorities can be able to identify potential issues and threats to alert individuals, making sure that their safe in such dangerous situations. These alerts can be sent instantly to personal devices, to provide guidance, warning and simple to ensure that they are safe. Along with that, having surveillance cameras public spaces and more high crime dominated areas, this could remind the offenders and make them aware of them being more easily caught and identified. This footage can also be used as it is valuable evidence, aiding law enforcements by identifying them easily and bringing them to justice.</p>
<p>In addition to reducing crime and terrorist attacks, government surveillance plays a vital role in taking care of public health. As COVID 19 hit us all, the US was not so quick to maintain the high spread of the disease. Digital tools, more so contact tracing apps were developed to track and notify others about their potential exposure to this disease. The use of integrating this app into the lives during a very rapid increasing disease was very helpful as it kept people in the know of who they have been in contact with, and to ensure their safety. Other surveillance systems could also be used to inform those in contact with infections people. These approaches can significantly reduce the transmission of the disease and protect the well being and health of the community. </p>
<p>Apart from that, most jobs require mobile phones and even provide work phones for each employee. The employer can locate and make sure each person is doing their task and not mucking around. Along with that, they can see how much progress each employee does and manage from there. People may think it is an invasion of privacy, it is also seen as a form of controlling. With the monitoring of the employeesâ€™ progress and activity, employers can find and identify areas to enhance overall efficiency, provide feedback and inform them of ways to improve.</p>
