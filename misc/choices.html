<h1><u>Technology Choices</h1></u>

<p>Despite the potential risks, the opportunities seem to outweigh the risks as it enhances the safety and security in the United States.  By utilising these surveillance procedures and measures, they can help contribute to keeping communities safe from various catastrophic events. Also, by reducing crime rates, such as cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, or any other illegal activities, people are less likely to be put in or exposed to danger.</p>
<p>However, it is essential to ensure that whoever has access to this surveillance data can be trusted, and that the privacy of individuals is respected. This will hopefully prevent unauthorised access, data breaches and data leaks. Implementing transparent practises and security and tough security measures, the government can reassure the inhabitants of the country that their data is not being exploited, leaked, sold, and making sure it is protected.</p>
<p>To conclude, with legitimate convers about data security and privacy, there are positives and advantages of government surveillance, in terms of public safety and crime prevention. Through establishing trust and being responsible and transparent, this will make government surveillance more effective and outweigh any potential risks.</p>
